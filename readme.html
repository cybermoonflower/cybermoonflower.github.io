				<p><i>"He has been called a thinker, and was certainly a man who was always thinking, and always thinking aloud; but it was not thought that fascinated him, but rather the processes by which thought moves. It was the machine he loved, not what the machine makes."</i> — Oscar Wilde</p>

				<p><i>"Yes: I am a dreamer. For a dreamer is one who can only find his way by moonlight, and his punishment is that he sees the dawn before the rest of the world."</i> — Oscar Wilde</p>

				<p><i>"When man acts he is a puppet. When he describes he is a poet."</i> — Oscar Wilde</p>

				<p><i>"This tremendous world I have inside of me. How to free myself, and this world, without tearing myself to pieces. And rather tear myself to a thousand pieces than be buried with this world within me."</i> — Kafka Franz</p>

				<p><i>“There is a secret medicine given only to those who hurt so hard they can't hope. The hopers would feel slighted if they knew.”</i> — Rumi</p>

				<p><i>"Night's gift, this sorrow<br>
				Is now tomorrow's faith"</i> <br>— Faiz Ahmed Faiz</p>

				<p><i>"They also serve who only stand and wait."</i> — John Milton</p>
